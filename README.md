# Projects-AI---ML
Hello, I'm Shreya. I'm exploring the world of AI and ML, and this is the best place to document my work.
Here, I'll store all my projects related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My goal is to document the processes I followed, the challenges I faced, and the solutions I found. Each project will include a brief description, the tools and technologies used, and the results achieved.

# Project 1 
❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This project uses logistic regression to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and chest pain type. The model was trained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset and achieved an accuracy of 90%. Key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score are used for evaluation, with visualizations to interpret model performance.
